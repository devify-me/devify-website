description: SQLite configuration for development and lightweight deployments.

SQLite is ideal for development and small deployments. No external database server needed.

## Configuration

```toml
[database]
engine = "sqlite"
name = "./data/app.db"
```

The `name` field is the file path for the SQLite database. Devify creates the file automatically.

## Table Prefix Isolation

Like MySQL, SQLite uses table prefixes:

- `auth_users`, `auth_password_resets`
- `rbac_roles`, `rbac_permissions`

## Advantages

- Zero setup — no database server to install or configure
- Single file — easy to backup and distribute
- Great for development and testing
- Pure Go driver (no CGO required)

## Limitations

- Not recommended for high-concurrency production workloads
- Limited concurrent write performance
- No schema-level isolation (uses table prefixes instead)

## Development Workflow

SQLite is perfect for quick iteration:

```bash
devify init my-app    # Select SQLite
devify migrate        # Creates ./data/app.db automatically
devify dev            # Start developing immediately
```
