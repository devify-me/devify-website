<Steps>

1. **Create a new project**

   ```bash
   devify init my-app
   ```

   The CLI will ask you to select a database engine (PostgreSQL is recommended) and whether to include an example module.

2. **Navigate into your project**

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Configure your database**

   Edit `config/config.toml` and set your database credentials:

   ```toml
   [database]
   engine = "postgres"
   host = "localhost"
   port = 5432
   name = "my_app_dev"
   user = "postgres"
   password = ""
   ssl_mode = "disable"
   ```

4. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   devify migrate
   ```

   This runs all pending migrations in dependency order — auth tables first, then RBAC tables.

5. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   devify dev
   ```

   This starts a hot-reloading dev server using Air. Your app is running at `http://localhost:4000`.

6. **Create your first module**

   ```bash
   devify module:create blog --routes --migrations --config
   ```

   This scaffolds a complete module at `modules/blog/` with routes, migrations, and a typed config struct.

7. **Register the module**

   Add your module to `cmd/app/main.go`:

   ```go
   k.Register(blogmod.New())
   ```

   The kernel handles dependency resolution, migration execution, and route mounting automatically.

</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

When you ran `devify dev`, the kernel:

1. Loaded config from `config/config.toml` with environment variable overrides
2. Created infrastructure adapters (database, cache, router)
3. Registered all modules and resolved dependencies via topological sort
4. Ran pending migrations for each module in dependency order
5. Initialized each module, wiring event subscriptions and services
6. Mounted HTTP routes and started the server
