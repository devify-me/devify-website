<Steps>

1. **Create a new project**

   ```bash
   devify init my-app
   ```

   The CLI will ask you to select a database engine (PostgreSQL is recommended) and whether to include an example module.

2. **Navigate into your project**

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Start services and the dev server**

   The project includes a generated `compose.yml` and `Makefile`. One command starts your database, mail server, and the hot-reloading dev server:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

   This starts your database container (PostgreSQL by default), Mailpit for local email testing, and the Air hot-reload server. Your app is running at `http://localhost:4000`.

   :::tip
   The `Makefile` auto-detects Podman or Docker — no configuration needed.
   :::

4. **Run migrations**

   In a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   devify migrate
   ```

   This runs all pending migrations in dependency order — auth tables first, then RBAC tables.

6. **Create your first module**

   ```bash
   devify module:create blog --routes --migrations --config
   ```

   This scaffolds a complete module at `modules/blog/` with routes, migrations, and a typed config struct.

7. **Register the module**

   Add your module to `cmd/app/main.go`:

   ```go
   k.Register(blogmod.New())
   ```

   The kernel handles dependency resolution, migration execution, and route mounting automatically.

</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

When you ran `devify dev`, the kernel:

1. Loaded config from `config/config.toml` with environment variable overrides
2. Created infrastructure adapters (database, cache, router)
3. Registered all modules and resolved dependencies via topological sort
4. Ran pending migrations for each module in dependency order
5. Initialized each module, wiring event subscriptions and services
6. Mounted HTTP routes and started the server
