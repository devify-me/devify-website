    <h2 class="section-title reveal">Everything a Go developer<br />needs. Nothing they don't.</h2>
    <p class="section-sub reveal">A framework that respects Go's philosophy &mdash; explicit, fast, zero magic &mdash; while giving you the productivity of a batteries-included toolkit.</p>

        <h3>Modular-Monolith Architecture</h3>
        <p>Each feature is a self-contained module with its own routes, handlers, services, repositories, migrations, and views. Snap them together through the kernel.</p>

        <h3>Single Binary Deploy</h3>
        <p>Everything compiles to one Go binary. No containers required, no service mesh, no orchestration. Just build and run.</p>

        <h3>Interface-Driven Kernel</h3>
        <p>Router, database, cache, mail, storage, events, scheduler &mdash; all defined as interfaces. Swap any implementation through config, not code changes.</p>

        <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
        <p>Modules declare dependencies explicitly. The kernel resolves them via topological sort, injects at boot, and refuses to start if something's wrong.</p>

        <h3>OAuth &amp; Auth Built In</h3>
        <p>Session, JWT, or OAuth2 &mdash; Google, GitHub, Discord out of the box. Argon2id hashing, password reset, account linking. Identity solved from day one.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Full-Stack Scaffolding</h3>
        <p>One interactive CLI generates a runnable project &mdash; pick your database, mail, storage, modules, OAuth, and frontend (HTMX or React/Vue/Svelte/SolidJS).</p>
